# Useful-Kernel-Links

## Purpose

To share links that we found useful in the due course of our jobs as Embedded Systems Engineers. But links are not restricted to Embedded systems , whereas it ranges from Web Development to Version Control to Embedded Systems.

## Link

This is hosted at https://arvindprksh.github.io/Useful-Kernel-Links/

## Help Required

* Help required for generating tags for all the links. Sorting is inefficient and not really useful in a big database of links
* Creating a proper framework to add links.
